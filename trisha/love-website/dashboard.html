                    Hi my girlfriend! I hope you enjoy the website that I made. I created it as a Christmas gift for you HEHEHE ingon sila, "forget love letters, we do websites now" maayo nalang naka sabay kos trend HAHAHA. Honestly, I failed on my first attempt sa paghimo. I lost motivation kadali, pero need lang diay ug focus maayo nalang on my second try, I was able to do it. Grabe gud akong kalipay ato, HEHEHE. Love, finishing this website made me realize how much I really wanted to do something special just for you. I made this website because you are very special to me. I never imagined that I would find a girl like you — someone so caring and loving. To be honest, you're different from anyone I've ever met before, and that's what makes you so special. I never expected that my first chat would turn into our love story. worth it kaayo akong pag first move kay parehas nata gikilig HAHA I thought you wouldn't notice me, or maybe imo lang ko i ignore. I even thought that once we met in person, your feelings might change, like you wouldn't be interested sa akoa. But you proved me wrong. Thank you love for accepting me for who I am. You didn't judge me instead, you loved me. I still remember the first time we met sa may crossing nga nag sakay ka ug motor, grabe kaayo maka-point sa finger murag dugay na kaayo ta nagkaila, HAHAHA. I thought everything would change sa imoha after seeing me in person. I was so shocked gud ato, and I can't explain what I felt at that moment. Sige lang kug smile ato while nag lakaw HAHAHA Just wanna tell you thank you for coming into my life. I wasn't looking for anything when I met you, I was just chatting you without expecting anything in return. I never expected to fall in love with you, but it happened, super gwapa man akong aki amo na inlove si jvy. I dont want a perfect relationship, but i need one that puts God first. I don't want to find other girls, because I already have a beautiful girlfriend and you are the one I want to keep forever. Forever yours, jvy
